Using a robot to play chess
This was a project that was done with a couple friends of mine for Robotics final assignment. 
In this project we as a group make the robot pick up the chess pieces (spawning of each chess piece was hard coded) and use the robots end effector to place these pieces on the chessboard. Although the robots flimsiness did make the recording difficult to make, there is a recording of what we accomplished.
